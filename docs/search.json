Currently, she is the Data Analytics Manager at Sony in the Risk and Control department.\nHeather has returned to the US to level up her skills by pursuing her Masters of Science in Data Science at her alma mater, Willamette University, and hopes to share her work experiences with people who are interested in pursuing a corporate career in Japan, especially women in the STEM fields. She would love to connect on LinkedIn or meet to grab a coffee while she’s in Portland."
